Embeddings
==========

- Module located : `langchain_huggingface`

`Embeddings`: it convert text into numerical vector and add semantic contextual meaning into it.

- Embeddings is mostly used with RAG applications.
- In industry most better accurate embeddings is `OpenAI`s, but that need API KEY (paid)
- other hand `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` this embedding model is best all rounder, and free to use. it create `384` size dence vector for each sentence.


What is the use of it?
======================

- when creating RAG system, we scrap data from sources and convert it as vector embeddings and store on `vector db`
