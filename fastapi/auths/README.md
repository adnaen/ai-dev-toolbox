- Authentication can be done mostly in 2 ways
    1. `Session Based`
    2. `Token Based`
- `Session Based` approached are not using in current applications.
That works when `php` application are trending.
- And, it have very cons. such as 
    - security threats
    - need to store session info on db.
    - and more...
- Current scenario mostly using `Token Based` authentication.

> [!NOTE]
> - `Authentication` : check who the user is, is a valid user. (in login)
> - `Authorization` : check what the user can access. (in resource access)
